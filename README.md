## USER STORIES
The user stories for this project are further explored in the project's <a href="https://github.com/users/AbraWalker/projects/11" target="blank">kanban board.</a>

-As a site user, I want to log in to submit my own reviews and interact with others’ reviews.
-As the site owner, I want to impose a character limit on every review, so users have to be concise.
-As a user, I want to be able to find reviews for games I care about.
-As an administrator, I want users to be able to delete their posts, but not edit them, so posts cannot be manipulated.
-As a site user, I don’t want to see content that is irrelevant, offensive, etc..
-As a site user, I want to track the games I have played.

## DESIGN
Taking these user stories into account, I wanted a site that was stylish and suitable to all ages to access.
It was important that the site did not look affiliated with other gaming companies, review sites or gaming platforms.

### COLOURS
The basic colour scheme I chose for my site is: </br>
`#4F000B` </br>
`#720026` </br>
`#CE4257` </br>
`#FF7F51` </br>
`#FF9B54` </br>
I decided the colours need to be bright, though not too similar to existing game-platform colour schemes. As these platforms tend to use dark blues/greens, I focused on warmer colours.
The palette can be viewed <a href="https://coolors.co/4f000b-720026-ce4257-ff7f51-ff9b54" target="blank">on Coolors</a>.

### FONTS
Due to the subject of the content, I chose fonts that were easy to read, and had a slight computerised theme.
[Electrolize](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Electrolize) for the logo.
[Nunito Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito+Sans) for the main body.
